# PythonTraning
his repo is my first repo, which will examine some short program with perhaps big power.

## Polynom
the module will represnet a polynom simple operations like add,multiply and compose of other polynoms in time complexity of O(1), then it will be possible to evaluate the polynom in time complexity of O(n).
all this will be fairly easy and possible using lambda expressions & clousres features in python :).
